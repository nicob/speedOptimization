<h4>Speed optimization project</h4>
<p>Tried to do all things that make a page load faster. Optimize images, minify files, remove comments, add media print to print styles etc.</p>
<p>Although I tried to implement all spped optimizations I still think have an issue with main.js (but maybe not)</p>
<p><em>You can see the optimized page online <a href="http://beligiannis.net/cameron/" target="_blank">here</a></em></p>
<p>Thank you</p>
